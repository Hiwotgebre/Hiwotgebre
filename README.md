# Recipe Search and Management Application

This React application allows users to search for recipes via the DummyJSON API and manage their favorite recipes. It features a dynamic search functionality that filters recipes according to user input and provides the ability to add or remove recipes from a favorites list.

## Features

- **List Recipes**: All recipes are listed on the main page, where users can browse through them.
- **Favorite Recipes**: Users can add recipes to their favorites list and view them on a separate page.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Used for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: Manages navigation between different parts of the application.
